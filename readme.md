# Simple ML

This repository contains examples of Jupyter notebooks using Machine Learning techniques to build models around simple datatasets.

 * The `mushrooms` folder uses _descision tree_ and _random forest_ models to predict which mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous.
 * The `titanic` folder uses _descision tree_ and _random forest_ models to predict which passengers survived the Titanic sink.
