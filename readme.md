# Simple ML

This repository contains examples of Jupyter notebooks and Python files that uses Machine Learning techniques to build simple models or agents.

 * The notebook on `disaster` folder uses _natural language processing_ to predict if a Tweet is announcing an emergency.
 * The notebook on `houses` folder uses _linear regression_ and _ridge regression_ models to predict the sales prices of houses.
 * The notebook on `mushrooms` folder uses _descision tree_ and _random forest_ models to predict which mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous.
 * The bot on `rock-paper-scissors` folder uses _reinforcement learning_ to play the Rock Paper Scissors game.
 * The notebook on `santa-tour` folder uses _linear programming_ to find the best way to schedule tours to a site with capacity constraints. 
 * The notebook on `titanic` folder uses _descision tree_ and _random forest_ models to predict which passengers survived the Titanic sink.
