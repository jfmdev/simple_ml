# Simple ML

This repository contains examples of Jupyter notebooks using Machine Learning techniques to build models around simple datatasets.

 * The `disaster` notebook uses _natural language processing_ to predict if a Tweet is announcing an emergency.
 * The `houses` notebook uses _linear regression_ and _ridge regression_ models to predict the sales prices of houses.
 * The `mushrooms` notebook uses _descision tree_ and _random forest_ models to predict which mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous.
 * The `titanic` notebook uses _descision tree_ and _random forest_ models to predict which passengers survived the Titanic sink.
